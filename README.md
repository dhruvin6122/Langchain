# LangChain Learning Series — 1-Day Intensive

Welcome to my **LangChain Learning Series**!  
This repository is a **hands-on, intensive learning journey** where I explored foundational to advanced concepts of LangChain and Ollama local LLMs in a single day.

---

## Day 1 — Concepts Learned

In this intensive session, I focused on understanding and implementing:

- **LLM Basics**  
  Learned how to initialize and interact with **Ollama local models**.

- **Prompt Engineering**  
  Explored **PromptTemplate** and structured prompts for different response styles.

- **Chains**  
  Understood **RunnableSequence** and **RunnableLambda** to create sequential workflows.

- **Memory Management**  
  Learned **short-term memory (ConversationBufferMemory)**, **summary memory (ConversationSummaryBufferMemory)**, and **hybrid memory** combining both.

## Mini Projects

1. **Simple Q&A Bot** — Ask questions and get responses from Ollama LLM.  
2. **Style Transfer Bot** — Responds in funny, formal, or kid-style tone using prompts.  
3. **Career Workflow Bot** — Sequential chain workflow for automating steps like summarizing, rephrasing, and answering.  
4. **AI Mentor with Short-Term Memory** — Remembers last 5 messages in a conversation.  
5. **AI Student Mentor with Hybrid Memory** — Combines short-term + summary memory to give career advice and next skill suggestions.

This repo is designed to **learn by doing**, and each mini project reinforces the concepts of LLMs, prompts, chains, and memory management.
